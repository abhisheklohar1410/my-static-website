      <h1>Disclaimer</h1>

      <p>
        The information provided on <strong>Fincalconline</strong> is for
        general informational and educational purposes only.
        All content and tools on this website are designed to help users
        think through financial decisions — not to provide personalized
        financial, legal, or tax advice.
      </p>

      <h2>No Financial Advice</h2>
      <p>
        Fincalconline does not offer investment advice, financial planning,
        tax advice, or legal advice. The tools and calculators simulate
        decision scenarios based on user inputs and assumptions, which may
        not reflect real-world outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        You should always consult with a qualified financial advisor,
        tax professional, or legal expert before making any major
        financial decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
      <p>
        While we strive to keep the information accurate and up to date,
        we make no warranties or representations regarding the completeness,
        reliability, or accuracy of any calculations, projections,
        or results displayed on this website.
      </p>

      <p>
        Financial outcomes depend on many factors including market conditions,
        personal behavior, economic changes, and regulatory environments,
        which are outside our control.
      </p>

      <h2>Risk Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        All financial decisions involve risk. Investments may lose value,
        income may change, and assumptions used in calculations may not hold
        true in the future. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Fincalconline and its creators shall not be held liable for any
        losses, damages, or decisions arising directly or indirectly
        from the use of this website, its tools, or its content.
      </p>
